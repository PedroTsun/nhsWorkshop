# Workshop on Web Design

Web pages were invented to facilitate the sharing of information. They
are also great for preserving information for both the author and other people.
Yes, you can use webpages like facebook and instagram  to preserve information,
but you lose control over how you would like to organize your information. There are
also other website hosting services like google site, but they place limits
on what you can do. Replit is one of the ways to make a website easily. It is
also easy for beginners to learn. If you become more interested in web design 
and web development, you may want to try github. The author would be glad to
share with you on how to make a website with github if you are interested.
